# genInstRank
Generate Instance A with the desired rank and density with control of their entries

There are two functions in this repository.

Function genA:

The function generates a random m × n dimensional matrix A with approximate
density d and singular values given by the non-negative input vector rc. 
The number of non-zero singular values in rc is of course the desired rank r
The matrix is generated by sprand using random plane rotations applied to a 
diagonal matrix with the given singular values. The shape of this
distribution is concave, and the entries are not extreme.

Function genAsym: 

The function generates a random m × m dimensional symmetric matrix A with
approximate density d and eigenvalues rc. The eigenvalues of A are given
as the input vector rc. The number of non-zero elements of rc is the 
desired rank r. The matrix is generated by sprandsym using random plane 
rotations applied to a diagonal matrix with the given singular values. 
The shape of this distribution is concave, and the entries are not extreme.
